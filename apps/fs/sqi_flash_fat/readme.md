# FAT filesystem using SST26 Media

This application shows an example of using the MPLAB Harmony File System to access SQI based SST26 flash media

## Description

### File System Operations on the On-Board SST26 Flash Memory:

- Performs a SYS_FS_FormatDisk
- Opens a **newfile.txt** on the SST26 flash
- Write and reads back 4KB of data on **newfile.txt**
- Verifies the Data Read back

### File system layer uses:
- One instance of the Memory driver is used to communicate with the On-Board SQI Flash memory
