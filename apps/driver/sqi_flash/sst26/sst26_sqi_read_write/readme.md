# SQI Flash SST26 driver - SST26 SQI Read Write

This example application shows how to use the SST26 driver to perform block operations on the On-Board SST26 Flash memory in Quad IO mode

## Description

### This application:

- Uses the SST26 driver to Erase/Write/Read on the On-Board SST26 Flash memory using the SQI peripheral library in Quad IO mode

- Consists of APP_SST26_Tasks() which is called through SYS_Tasks() routine
